# Abstract

This is a proposal of a design for pinning trusted keys, which would allow clients to root their trust at a namespace (or lower) delegated set of keys instead of the repository root.

An example use case: I trust django's published public keys to have signed off on django, but I don't necessarily trust PyPI to remain uncompromised (and possibly convince me of different public keys for django).

This proposal also addresses the problem of private metadata. In the current TUF spec, there is no way to hide all information about the existence of other metadata in the system. This is a problem in a multi-tenant scenario where knowledge of metametadata could be sensitive (e.g. timing of creating a target, names of targets, etc).

# Specification

We introduce a new, required file, `pinned.json`, which permits users to pin root files and associate them with a particular namespace prefix. If an entry matches the current package, the pinned root must be used. If it does not match, there is a fallback to the global root.

This constructs two (or more) trust paths for target files, and allows the user to pick between them. Clients that trust the global root (e.g. PyPI) will trust all packages served by it, and those that wish to root trust with a namespace owner (e.g. django project) can pin to those keys. See [this diagram for an example](tap-0003-files/pinning_trust_diagram.png).

Because the pinning mechanism uses roots, the "pinned" keys may be rotated according to the standard root rotation scheme. In that sense, you are pinning the root of a tree of keys which can grow over time, rather than pinning a set of keys that must never change.

## Pin File

`pinned.json` maps a prefix to a location where the pinned root can be found and an optional url for updating it. This file is not available from a TUF repository. It is either constructed by explicit actions from the client (e.g. "pin this role's keys") or by an out-of-band bootstrap (e.g. "here's our organization's `pinned.json`").  

```javascript
 {
   "django": {
      "location": "pinned/django",  // default pinned directory structure
      "url": "https://www.djangoproject.com/release/metadata"
   },
   "private-requests-beta": {
      "location": "pinned/requests"
       // no url - can't be updated automatically
   },
   "private-flask-beta": {
      "location": "/usr/local/evan/flask-beta" // metadata can live elsewhere if desired
   }
 }
```

## Pinned Metadata
Pinned metadata lives in a specific default directory, sharing the same layout as a "normal" repo but nested within a prefix namespace, e.g.

```
pinned
└── django  // prefix
    ├── root.json
    ├── snapshot.json
    ├── targets.json
    └── timestamp.json
```

This can be changed with the `location` field of the `pinned.json` file, which may be useful if e.g. sharing a network drive.

Complex ACLs can be enforced and/or bootstrapped by sending a user an appropriately generated `pinned.json`, noting that any metadata endpoint (root repo, or any pinned repo) can have its own access control mechanism.

## Hiding 

A private package can be omitted from the primary hierarchy entirely, having its own `snapshot` and `target` files separate from those provided with `root`. The `snapshot.json` and `target.json` could be signed with the same snapshot and target keys used for the public parts of the repository, or they can be managed and signed by the owner of the private delegated role. Access to these private roles is granted by sending the metadata to the appropriate users (further restricted by ACLs if needed). A url pointing to where the snapshot and timestamp can be found is added to the `pinned.json` file in the case of private roles.

## Hard Pinning

Hard pinning, in which a specific set of non-changing keys are used, can be accomplished by creating the a pinned metadata repository and not specifying a url. Without a url, nothing can convince a client to use different keys. This may be useful for priming a box for a one-time initial pull (with the assumption that it will be killed rather than updated directly). 

## Repository structure

With this pinning structure it makes sense to structure namespaces and/or packages with their own roots. Alternately, a user can generate a root for a given package/target delegation locally if it doesn't exist, by generating keys locally and signing.

Because a delegation is also a target file, a global root can delegate to target files of other repos. This allows a simple way to provide both global and namespaced target files.

It's worth mentioning that Notary has a pinning implementation currently. Although this proposal differs and has slightly different goals, the Notary format should be compatible with this through a simple transformation.
